### 2. Remount the Root Filesystem as Read/Write

Once you‚Äôre in the recovery shell (root shell prompt):

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```

3. Free Up Disk Space
Now that the filesystem is writable, clear space with the following steps:

Clean old logs:
```
journalctl --vacuum-time=1d
rm -rf /var/log/journal/*
```

```
rm -rf /var/tmp/*
rm -rf /tmp/*
```


Clear package cache:
```
apt clean
```



Find and remove large files:
```
du -ahx / | sort -rh | head -20

```



Then Restart your system to listen what I've done

```
reboot
```
